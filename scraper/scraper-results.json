The Ascent is the result of years of learning from the success of former Scott products like the BackSpin, Halo, and many of the Scott family hinge releases. In this new technology, Scott family engineers brought many of the best features of releases like the back spin to the forefront again in what has become the hottest archery release aid in 2019. Struggling with Target Panic? Check out this article from Chance Beaubouef. What is Target Panic? To me, target panic is a mental issue. It really comes down to fear of failure. For most, it comes out as an inability to put your sight pin on the target and execute a clean shot without the anticipation of missing. Darrin Christenberry | Scott Archery Pro Staff Manager There are so many people out there that have lost the enjoyment of shooting because of target panic and been driven to quit shooting all together. They struggle to execute a good shot without having the feeling of anxiety or even being able to get the pin on target. Having gone through it myself, I have personally felt the struggle and the pain that target panic can cause. Chance Beaubouef | Professional Archer Most people at some point struggle with target panic. It is completely mental, much like the “yips” in golf. To get through it you just have to stay committed and mentally fight through the anxiety. The best Scott release for target panic would probably be the Ascent. With the adjustments, you can set it to a perfect and consistent shot timing fit to you to alleviate some anxiety in the shot.

Until now there’s never been a commercially available knee cushion for saddle hunters.We worked with Justin Oosterbaan to design this version of the Knushion. It’s a sleek, simple knee cushion that installs in seconds without adding unnecessary weight or bulk to your pack. The Knushion hits the sweet spot of comfort and packability. We built the Knushion with ultra-strong and durable RhinoSkin fabric that grips your knees and resists wear.It doesn’t matter if you prefer knee pads, or knee cushions. Our crew actually uses both. What really matters is now you have options. The Knushion is another tool to help you become a more efficient, comfortable, and light weight saddle hunter.

Of course, our first call was to The Hunting Public. We enlisted their help to figure out exactly what mobile turkey hunters need while deleting all the extra nonsense. Next, we worked with Mossy Oak to build a one-of-a-kind fabric with their best-selling camo pattern of all time: Bottomland. INCLUDED COMPONENTS M2 Waist Belt (S/M or L/XL) M2 Seat Cushion M2 Yoke M2 Horizontal Pockets M2 Turkey Accessory Kit Box Call Holder Pot Call Holder Shell Holder Striker Holder M2 Yoke Diaphragm Holder Dog Bone Connectors (x2) Ultralight Straps (x2) M2 Modular Bird Bag or M2 Hydration Bag MOBILE The M2 Turkey vest is designed to be high speed, low drag. It's quiet and nimble. It's lightweight without sacrificing functionality. It's everything a mobile turkey hunter needs, and nothing they don't. We took inspiration from Greg \u0026 Carl's time on Active Duty in the Army \u0026 Navy and the purpose built, no-nonsense gear our service men \u0026 women use on a daily basis. Then we leveraged THP's turkey hunting know-how to make the M2 a turkey hunter's dream vest. It turns out making gear bombproof, quiet, and light weight is harder than it looks. It took us over 2 years to get the M2 EXACTLY how we wanted it. The result is the M2 Vest that fits tight to your body so you can move quickly and quietly through the turkey woods. MODULARWe believe in modularity at Tethrd. We want you to use your gear in a way that suits your style and preference. So many turkey vests out there want to pigeonhole you into putting your friction call in 1 specific place and your box call in another. We designed the M2 to be extremely modular so you can design your gear to fit your needs. It's also infinitely expandable for the minimalist or the maximalist. You can load the M2 up with TONS of gear if that's your thing. The M2 will work with any MOLLE compatible item on the planet. And you don't have to buy it from us. On the other hand, you can dress down the M2 into a small, nimble setup if you like to carry the bare minimum. WisprTUFFThe M2 is made of a proprietary fabric we're calling WisprTUFF. It's as quiet as a church mouse, yet tough as nails. It's a two-layer laminated fabric that's soft and quiet on the outside but built like a tank on the inside. It's the best of both worlds. Mossy Oak helped us design and manufacture WisprTUFF and of course we printed it in their Bottomland camo pattern. Quiet. Tough. Sexy. WIN. WIN. WIN. BIRD BAG OR HYDRATION KITWhen you purchase the M2 Vest you get the option of the Hydration Pack or the Expandable Bird Bag. If you like to carry decoys and then drop that Tom into your bag after the kill, you should get the Expandable Bird Bag. If you're a bit more of a minimalist and prefer to haul your Gobbler out over your shoulder with a turkey tote, you might want to get the Hydration Pack. Shooter's choice. MADE IN THE USAWe made the M2 right here in the USA. We like to say, \"buy once cry once\". The price of the M2 is a bit higher than some of the inexpensive options made overseas. That's what happens when you work with American companies, who employ American labor, in American facilities, inside American neighborhoods. The result is a higher-than-average price to the consumer. We believe it's worth it, and if you give it a try, we think you will too. 3-6 lbs (Depending on configuration) MOLLE compatible for infinite expansion Modular components to mix-and-match your ultimate kit Accessory options available Proprietary WisprTUFF fabric in Mossy Oak Bottomland Portions of each sale goes to Turkey Conservation Made in the USA M2 vest kit (Yoke, belt, pouches, pad) = 49.2 oz or 3 lbs 3ozM2 + hydro = 64 oz or 4 lbsM2 + Birdbag = 67.5 oz or 4 lbs 3oz.","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/m2-thp-turkey-hunting-vest","category":"Gear","tags":["onX","P\u0026S","sale","turkey"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"49765472338201","title":"S/M / M2 Bird Bag","availability":false,"price":249.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/m2-bird-bag-system.jpg?v=1728082310"},{"sku":"49765472370969","title":"S/M / M2 Hydro Pack","availability":false,"price":249.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/m2-hydration-pack-system.jpg?v=1728082315"},{"sku":"49765472403737","title":"LG/XL / M2 Bird Bag","availability":false,"price":249.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/m2-bird-bag-system.jpg?v=1728082310"},{"sku":"49765472436505","title":"LG/XL / M2 Hydro Pack","availability":false,"price":249.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/m2-hydration-pack-system.jpg?v=1728082315"}]}],"M2 Turkey Vest - Pack Options":[{"name":"M2 Turkey Vest - Pack Options","brand":"Tethrd","description":"","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/m2-turkey-pack","category":"Gear","tags":["turkey"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"ACC-M2-BRDBAG","title":"M2 Bird Bag","availability":false,"price":69.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/M2_Bird_Bag.jpg?v=1728076714"},{"sku":"ACC-M2-HYDRO","title":"M2 Hydro Pack","availability":false,"price":69.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/M2_Hydrop_Pack.jpg?v=1728076682"}]}],"M2 Vertical Pouches":[{"name":"M2 Vertical Pouches","brand":"Tethrd","description":"Weight: 10.69 oz","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/m2-vertical-pouches","category":"Gear","tags":["all","onX","P\u0026S","sale","turkey"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"ACC-M2-VERT","title":"Default Title","availability":true,"price":44.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/P1000438.jpg?v=1712086721"}]}],"M2 Yoke":[{"name":"M2 Yoke","brand":"Tethrd","description":"This is one size fits all \u0026 is included in the kit.

If you are a small-large hunter, go with the standard. If you are an XL hunter, go with the XL. The Modular Versatile Panel was built to add even more flexibility to our single panel saddle systems. It can replace the Recliner if a hunter feels they need something just a little more robust.It was designed to go from your “knee pits to your arm pits”. Because of the modular build, it can work with any saddle system, no matter the brand or design. The construction was beefed up quite a bit from the Recliner and designed to by bomb proof.We also built the MVP around two off-the-shelf and user replaceable elastic ITW clips. This is designed to connect the MVP to your bridge loops and keep it EXACTLY where you want it for lower back support. We originally created some proprietary methods for this connection, but in the end we decided to make it roll-tide-simple.The MVP comes in two sizes: standard \u0026 XL. If you buy jackets or hoodies in sizes Small-XL you should get the standard sized MVP. If your jackets and hoodies are 2X+, you should go with the XL. The XL adds even more length to get the buckles further in front of the hunter for quick \u0026 easy adjustments.Should I replace my Recliner with the MVP?Maybe. Greg decided to run the original Recliner, but Ernie likes the greater versatility of the MVP. If you’re more of a minimalist in your setup, we recommend the Recliner. But if you’ve ever found yourself wanting a more substantial back support, or you’ve been curious about a 2 panel saddle…the MVP can give you the best of both worlds.All 2 panel saddles (even our ESS) have a flaw. Neither panel can be adjusted truly independently of one another for better back support. Because they are connected at the bridge loops, the movement of one panel must affect the movement of the other. This tends to not be an issue when a hunter is overlapping the panels for a deeper or more shallow seat. However, when it comes to back support, a traditional 2 panel saddle kinda sucks.Since the MVP is an independent panel connected to your tether carabiner, you can put it wherever you want.Under your knees? YUP.Way up under your arm pits? YUP.Overlapping your saddle for more support?

Ladies and Gentlemen, we present to you: the climbing stick – perfected, now in color! One pound per stick INCLUDING our patent-pending attachment system. The Tethrd One climbing stick is the lightest, full-featured climbing stick on planet Earth. Honestly...it's not even close. A BARELY ONE POUND PER STICK Our One climbing stick achieves an industry first ONE pound weight INCLUDING the DynaLite™ Rope attachment.* Most companies don't even include the weight of their ropes, buckles, and straps. We think that's dishonest. The weight we claim is the real weight ready to hunt. The 6061 CNC precision machined step-standoff one-piece design is deadly quiet and maximizes strength. This combined with our titanium tube means the Tethrd One Stick is featherlight to pack in, yet easy to maneuver and set in the tree. The Tethrd One stick is engineered with Grade 9 aerospace titanium. It is immune to corrosion, 50% lighter than steel, and 300% stronger than aluminum.** This seamless construction yields EXTREME strength-to-weight ratios. FAST \u0026 QUIET INSTALLATION Our Patent pending DynaLoc™ tab allows for quick, quiet, and simple attachment. The proprietary DynaLite™ rope system is the lightest, simplest, and most innovative quick-attach system ever developed. On top of a strength rating of well over 2,000 lbs, the intuitive X-lock design provides positive tactile feedback that lets you feel the stick locking to the tree. In our unofficial \"bubba testing\", we were able to install and lock a One stick to the tree in less than 5 seconds. Oh yeah...it was completely silent and included no buckles. MAXIMUM BOOT AREA The one piece step/standoff creates a generous boot gripping step size for comfortable, confident climbing. It includes an 8.5\" dual-step width for maximum agility. Our boot containment design engineered into the step geometry, combined with smart traction tread, gives hunters maximum climbing real estate while allowing the top stick to be used as a saddle hunting platform for a quick-and-dirty hunt. SUPER COMPACT \u0026 QUIET STACKING Our patent pending StickLoc™ stacking system is intuitive, whisper quiet, and incredibly strong. It allows you to quickly and efficiently align and stack sticks together for easy transport...no extra straps or fiddle factor required. Integrated rubber o-rings keep your sticks weather proof and noise free. The StickLoc™ pins are a consumable part. Each set of One Sticks will ship with a replacement set of pins. You can also buy more to have extras on hand (coming soon). GLO-TAB REFLECTION TECHNOLOGY We built innovative self-illuminating GLO-tabs into each step. This allows safer climbing and descending during low light. Hunters get increased function and safety without a weight penalty. FIDDLE FACTOR FREE We built several iterations of climbing sticks over 2 years. Original prototypes included a folding and rotating step design. We all agreed after extensive testing that there was too much \"fiddle factor\". When a hunter finds a hunting location, it's time to hunt. Hunters shouldn't fiddle around with bolts, and locks, and moving steps. At the end of the hunt, who wants to spend extra time changing your climbing sticks back into pack mode? Not us. Fiddling around with moving parts adds frustration and introduces the potential for noise. With ZERO moving parts, and a roll-tide-simple attachment system, we engineered the One stick to be FIDDLE FACTOR FREE...just how it should be.

Gone are the days of agonizing over “which size should I buy?” or reaching out to social media to ask more experienced saddle hunters. The patent pending shape and cut means the Phantom® fits waist sizes from 28 inches to 40 inches. We recommend the Phantom® XL for waist sizes over 36-38 inches or if you have a big ol’ butt. If you’ve got some serious junk-in-the-trunk, the XL might be just the ticket for you. A shorter, more robust hunter might also prefer the XL. COMFORT CHANNELSThe patent pending Comfort Channels™ provide all day, unsurpassed comfort with easy to use high, medium, and low support settings. The Comfort Channels allow simple, one-handed, adjustment for leaning trees, and give you full control over where you need support most. If you like lower back support, move to the “high” Comfort Channel. If you like more support under your seat, move to the “low” Comfort Channel. UTILIBRIDGE™In the past hunters had to sacrifice user-friendliness, or accept more weight and bulk, to have a truly on-demand adjustable bridge. The patent pending UtiliBridge™ is the first of it’s kind constructed with Dynalite™. Our proprietary Dynalite™ material is made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and is one of the strongest pound for pound fibers on the planet. It’s stronger than steel. It floats. It’s weather resistant. It’s ultralight. It can hold a jeep. Dynalite™ is perfect for outdoor applications. With nearly 37 inches of on-the-fly adjustability, everyone can find their saddle hunting sweet spot. There’s no metal, no bulk, and it’s the strongest adjustable bridge ever made. The UtiliBridge™ checks all the boxes and has tons of upside potential. Looking for the down side? Good luck. LINEMAN LOOPSThe Phantom has re-engineered lineman loops to make them more user friendly and even stronger than ever. The large lineman loops are easier to find and use in the dark even with gloves on your hands during the late season. Rest assured the Phantom’s lineman loops will handle anything you can throw at them. SPECIAL EDITION SYS HAULERSWe think the SYS Haulers are essential to keep your gear organized and efficient. The Phantom Elite kit comes with 2 special edition SYS Haulers with upgraded secure storage. There’s no limit to what you can store with your SYS Haulers. We like to run our tether and lineman belt on our left hip, and necessary accessories (like the MVP or HYS Strap) on our right hips. However, there’s no wrong way to do it. Since each SYS Hauler is modular and extremely light weight, you can use them to fit your needs. SPECIAL EDITION MVPOur Modular Versatile Panel (MVP) gives you all day comfort without sacrificing weight and bulk. It was designed to go from your “knee pits to your arm pits”. Because of the modular build, it can work with any saddle system, no matter the brand or design. The construction was beefed up quite a bit from the Recliner and designed to by bomb proof. With the MVP you get all the benefits of a 2-panel saddle system without the downsides. Not only is the Phantom Elite saddle is 100% made in America. The accessories are made with our overseas partners to keep costs down. If you’re looking to be a more efficient hunter and eliminate as much weight and bulk as possible, congratulations…mission accomplished.","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/phantom-elite-saddle","category":"Accessories","tags":["all","buyback","onX","saddle","sale"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"ELITE-BL","title":"Bottomland / Regular","availability":true,"price":359.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/P1003801-Edit_631f1456-59e3-46a7-82df-4fbb396afc54.jpg?v=1717535030"},{"sku":"ELITE-BL-XL","title":"Bottomland / XL","availability":true,"price":386.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/P1003801-Edit_631f1456-59e3-46a7-82df-4fbb396afc54.jpg?v=1717535030"},{"sku":"SDL1-PHAE-REG","title":"Specter / Regular","availability":false,"price":359.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/PhantomElite-14_45003a33-7585-4ad3-964e-95977d0690c7.jpg?v=1713884122"},{"sku":"SDL1-PHAE-XL","title":"Specter / XL","availability":true,"price":386.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/PhantomElite-14_45003a33-7585-4ad3-964e-95977d0690c7.jpg?v=1713884122"}]}],"Phantom Elite Starter Kit":[{"name":"Phantom Elite Starter Kit","brand":"Tethrd","description":"What's in the kit: Phantom Elite Saddle in Mossy Oak Bottomland (Reg or XL), Lineman Belt (8mm or 11mm), Tree Tether (8mm or 11mm), Mossy Oak Bottomland SYS Haulers (2), Mossy Oak Bottomland MVP.","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/phantom-elite-saddle-hunting-starter-kit","category":"Miscellaneous","tags":["new","onX","sale","starterkit"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"49827491381529","title":"Regular / 11mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":421.17,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-11mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952447070489","title":"Regular / 11mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":429.17,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-11mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952447103257","title":"Regular / 8mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":433.57,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-8mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952447136025","title":"Regular / 8mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":441.57,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-8mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952446251289","title":"XL / 11mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":445.17,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-11mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952447168793","title":"XL / 11mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":453.17,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-11mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952447201561","title":"XL / 8mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":457.57,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-8mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732026508"},{"sku":"49952447234329","title":"XL / 8mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":465.57,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/phantom-elite-starter-kit-8mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732026508"}]}],"Phantom Saddle":[{"name":"Phantom Saddle","brand":"Tethrd","description":"The Phantom is 100% Made in the USA.

Weighing just 2.3 lbs for the Regular, and 3.25 lbs for the XL, the Predator CFX will give you the extra edge you need this fall without the extra weight. Pair the regular CFX platform with a 3-pack of ultralight Tethrd ONE sticks and your climbing setup will be a featherlight 5 pounds 7 ounces. Industry Leading Carbon Fiber Not all carbon fiber is created equally. Just like there are qualitative levels with steel, aluminum, and other metals related to hardness, flexibility, and strength; the same standards apply to carbon fiber. We've partnered with arguably the top carbon fiber manufacturer in the country, famous for high performance race cars and off-road vehicle engineering.We use a proprietary compound known as Tetra CF2™ to produce parts certified to hold up to 4x the required standard at a lower weight than aluminum. This makes the Predator CFX platform the most bad a**, tough as nails, top of the line carbon fiber product in the industry. Our unique Carbon Fiber Forged™ process makes this the strongest, lightest, and quietest platform we've ever made. Product Features Best in class weight savings at only 2.3 lbs (regular size).

The Tethrd Skeletors are the best mid-priced portable climbing stick on the planet. First, we released the Tethrd One Sticks to be the most lightweight, packable, and mobile climbing stick on the planet. We used ultra-high-end materials and proprietary construction methods in order to achieve a One-Pound climbing stick (including the attachment method). We are the first in the world to bring this type of lightweight climbing to hunters. The downside is the One Sticks are expensive and hard to make. Enter the Skeletors. The Skeletors are designed to be budget friendly, but still include many of the features we engineered into our One Sticks. The Skeletors are built with a folding dual step design that folds AWAY from the tree. Folding away from the tree gives the hunter more room for their feet when climbing. Is that a major life-changing feature? Probably not, but attention to detail counts when you're trying to be the most efficient hunter you can be. The Skeletors attach to the tree with our patented DynaLite rope and tab. It's the most user friendly, lightweight, simple, and fast connection method in history. There are no heavy buckles. There are no mechanical pieces. There is no fiddle factor. Stacking your Skeletors for transport is a breeze with our built in StickLoc pin system. Simply align the pins and stack away. We're also introducing our patent-pending RCS (Rope Containment System). Manage your DynaLite ropes quickly and easily with a Roll-Tide-Simple RCS.

That’s the reason it’s the greatest selling saddle of all time. But we listened to you guys who were willing to carry a bit more weight \u0026 bulk in exchange for maximum comfort and created the Ultralock. This thing is the Cadillac of Comfiness! The Ultralock includes: Ultralock Expandable Saddle, UtiliBridge™ \u0026 Comfort Channels™, 2x Ultralock Haulers with IFS, Ultralock Modular Yoke, 2 sets of Ultralock Links Regular = 28″-36″ waist | XL = +38″ waist The Ultralock saddle is the KING of COMFORT. Over the past 2 years we've tested and refined a new approach to our saddle lineup. We wanted to reimagine comfort and user-friendliness. The Ultralock takes the best in class features from our Phantom like our UtiliBridge™, Comfort Channels™, and integrated lineman loops and adds in our Expandable Saddle Body with Ultralock Link construction to create a mega-comfortable saddle that expands and contracts with you throughout your hunt. Not only does the Ultralock revolutionize comfort in a saddle, but our new oversized Ultralock Haulers with integrated skeleton frame make frustrating gear access a thing of the past. Finally, our new bomb proof yoke system means you can load up your Ultralock and not worry about keeping it in place. The Ultralock is the next evolution in saddle hunting comfort. You're gonna LOVE it. ULTRALOCK LINKS Our brand new Ultralock Links are a fresh take on an expandable saddle. The biggest complaint with pleated saddles is the inability to close the pleat while in transport mode moving to and from your hunting area. They tend to open at the wrong time and flop around. Pleated saddles all suffer from this issue and can lead to an annoying user experience. We re-engineered the concept and created an Expandable Saddle Body to work hand-in-hand with our Ultralock Link system to solve this issue. Our Expandable Saddle Body allows the saddle to move with you while walking, climbing, and hunting. The Ultralock Links are removable, adjustable, and user replaceable. Hunters can dial in their specific comfort setting, and replace them if they wear out, get lost, or get damaged. You get two sets with the Ultralock : 1 pre-installed, and 1 replacement set. ULTRALOCK HAULERS Our brand new Ultralock Hauler with built in IFS (Internal Frame Structure) is the first of its kind. With IFS, gear management becomes so much easier. Ultralock Haulers work like a dream by providing an incredibly simple one-handed operation. We also made the Ultralock haulers plenty big for those who like to carry lots of gear. We doubled the volume compared to our original SYS Haulers, while reducing the exterior profile to make the Ultralock even more sleek. They're sewn right into the saddle body which adds structure \u0026 comfort to the entire system. Finally, we added plenty of organization, and even a built-in grommet system for those who use a retractable gear hoist. Get Haulin! ULTRALOCK MODULAR YOKE Our brand new Yoke System takes Tethrd saddles to the next level. If you have issues with your saddle not wanting to stay put where you like it, our Yoke will solve that problem. It's light weight, modular, and bombproof. The Ultralock comes with the Yoke ready to go. It's also removable in about 15 seconds. If you want to run your Ultralock in minimalist mode, drop the Yoke at home and head to the woods. Finally, the Yoke is backwards compatible with our Phantom Saddle for when you want to hunt even lighter and faster. UTILIBRIDGE™ \u0026 COMFORT CHANNELS™ Our patented UtiliBridge™ is the KING of adjustable saddle hunting bridges. Your bridge is incredibly important for comfort, durability, and 360 degree shooting. With nearly 40 inches of on-the-fly adjustability, everyone can find their saddle hunting sweet spot. UtiliBridge™ works with your setup to make every hunt as simple as possible. Our patented Comfort Channels™ provide all day, unsurpassed comfort with seven different high, medium, and low support settings. The Comfort Channels allow simple, one-handed adjustment for leaning trees and weird positions, while giving you full control over where you need support most. MADE IN THE USA...MOSTLY In order to protect your wallets, we chose to manufacture the Ultralock in a unique way. We built the load bearing components (Saddle Chassis, Bridge Loops, UtiliBridge, Lineman Loops, etc.) here in the USA. To save you money, we imported the non-load bearing components (Ultralock Haulers \u0026 Yoke) from our overseas partners and assembled everything right here in Texas. This way you get the best of both worlds: Made in America load bearing components \u0026 assembly, and wallet-friendly off-shore accessories. So rest assured, if you see any \"made in China\" tags or uninformed comments on social media...that only applies to the non-load bearing accessories. We want to be transparent and honest so there's no surprises.","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/ultralock-saddle","category":"Accessories","tags":["all","buyback","onX","saddle","sale"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"LKDWN","title":"REG","availability":true,"price":386.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-11.jpg?v=1710337544"},{"sku":"LKDWN-XL","title":"XL","availability":true,"price":404.1,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-11.jpg?v=1710337544"}]}],"Ultralock Saddle Starter Kit":[{"name":"Ultralock Saddle Starter Kit","brand":"Tethrd","description":"What's in the bundle: Ultralock Expandable Hunting Saddle (Reg or XL), Lineman Belt (8mm or 11mm), Tree Tether (8mm or 11mm)","product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/ultralock-hunting-saddle-starter-kit","category":"Miscellaneous","tags":["new","onX","sale","starterkit"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"49748450345241","title":"REG / 11mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":445.17,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-11mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49952647774489","title":"REG / 11mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":453.17,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-11mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49952647807257","title":"REG / 8mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":457.57,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-8mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49952647840025","title":"REG / 8mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":465.57,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-8mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49748450476313","title":"XL / 11mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":460.38,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-11mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49952647872793","title":"XL / 11mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":468.38,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-11mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49952647905561","title":"XL / 8mm / 11mm","availability":true,"price":472.78,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-8mm-11mm.jpg?v=1732028456"},{"sku":"49952647938329","title":"XL / 8mm / 8mm","availability":true,"price":480.78,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0858/8194/6393/files/ultralock-starter-kit-8mm-8mm.jpg?v=1732028456"}]}],"Ultrarest Integrate MX2™":[{"name":"Ultrarest Integrate MX2™","brand":"Mathews Archery","description":"Mathews teamed up with Quality Archery Design (QAD) to introduce the all-new UltraRest® Integrate MX2™.","product_url":"https://mathewsinc.com/products/ultrarest-integrate-mx2™","category":"Accessories","tags":["Featured"],"weight":0,"weight_unit":"","length":0,"draw_weights":null,"draw_lengths":null,"variants":[{"sku":"80396","title":"Right Handed","availability":true,"price":299.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0886/7230/5465/files/QAD_IMX2_Rest-Front.png?v=1725897611"},{"sku":"80395","title":"Left Handed","availability":true,"price":299.99,"image_url":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0886/7230/5465/files/QAD_IMX2_Rest-Front.png?v=1725897611"}]}],"Ultrarest TRi™ Target Rest":[{"name":"Ultrarest TRi™ Target Rest","brand":"Mathews Archery","description":"We partnered with Quality Archery Designs (QAD) to bring you the all-new Ultrarest TRi Target Rest.

Heavy enough for whatever you throw at it. Built to keep your platform handy during your trek while you search for that perfect tree. The Universal Platform Pack can be worn as a stand alone pack (minimalist pack straps included), or used as an attachment for your separate, more fully-featured pack. We like to use ours as a stand alone pack during the early season and add a couple MOLLE pouches to it via our RAD system. When it gets colder, we like to attach the Platform Pack to a separate pack and use it as a compression panel (Compression Kit required). The Universal Platform Pack comes in two sizes, regular and XL, and will fit all Tethrd platforms respective to size. The new semi-rigid foam construction provides additional structure to the pack for attaching accessories and improves usability and packability. No matter how you use the Universal Platform Pack it’s a great piece of gear to make you a more efficient hunter. Product Features Fits all Tethrd platforms respective to size (regular / XL).
