One pound per stick INCLUDING our patent-pending attachment system. The Tethrd One climbing stick is the lightest, full-featured climbing stick on planet Earth. Honestly...it's not even close.\nA BARELY ONE POUND PER STICK\nOur One climbing stick achieves an industry first ONE pound weight INCLUDING the DynaLite™ Rope attachment.* Most companies don't even include the weight of their ropes, buckles, and straps. We think that's dishonest. The weight we claim is the real weight ready to hunt. The 6061 CNC precision machined step-standoff one-piece design is deadly quiet and maximizes strength. This combined with our titanium tube means the Tethrd One Stick is featherlight to pack in, yet easy to maneuver and set in the tree. The Tethrd One stick is engineered with Grade 9 aerospace titanium. It is immune to corrosion, 50% lighter than steel, and 300% stronger than aluminum.** This seamless construction yields EXTREME strength-to-weight ratios.\nFAST \u0026amp; QUIET INSTALLATION\nOur Patent pending DynaLoc™ tab allows for quick, quiet, and simple attachment. The proprietary DynaLite™ rope system is the lightest, simplest, and most innovative quick-attach system ever developed. On top of a strength rating of well over 2,000 lbs, the intuitive X-lock design provides positive tactile feedback that lets you feel the stick locking to the tree. In our unofficial \"bubba testing\", we were able to install and lock a One stick to the tree in less than 5 seconds. Oh yeah...it was completely silent and included no buckles.\nMAXIMUM BOOT AREA\nThe one piece step/standoff creates a generous boot gripping step size for comfortable, confident climbing. It includes an 8.5\" dual-step width for maximum agility. Our boot containment design engineered into the step geometry, combined with smart traction tread, gives hunters maximum climbing real estate while allowing the top stick to be used as a saddle hunting platform for a quick-and-dirty hunt.\nSUPER COMPACT \u0026amp; QUIET STACKING\nOur patent pending StickLoc™ stacking system is intuitive, whisper quiet, and incredibly strong.

One pound per stick INCLUDING our patent-pending attachment system. The Tethrd One climbing stick is the lightest, full-featured climbing stick on planet Earth. Honestly...it's not even close.\nA BARELY ONE POUND PER STICK\nOur One climbing stick achieves an industry first ONE pound weight INCLUDING the DynaLite™ Rope attachment.* Most companies don't even include the weight of their ropes, buckles, and straps. We think that's dishonest. The weight we claim is the real weight ready to hunt. The 6061 CNC precision machined step-standoff one-piece design is deadly quiet and maximizes strength. This combined with our titanium tube means the Tethrd One Stick is featherlight to pack in, yet easy to maneuver and set in the tree. The Tethrd One stick is engineered with Grade 9 aerospace titanium. It is immune to corrosion, 50% lighter than steel, and 300% stronger than aluminum.** This seamless construction yields EXTREME strength-to-weight ratios.\nFAST \u0026amp; QUIET INSTALLATION\nOur Patent pending DynaLoc™ tab allows for quick, quiet, and simple attachment. The proprietary DynaLite™ rope system is the lightest, simplest, and most innovative quick-attach system ever developed. On top of a strength rating of well over 2,000 lbs, the intuitive X-lock design provides positive tactile feedback that lets you feel the stick locking to the tree. In our unofficial \"bubba testing\", we were able to install and lock a One stick to the tree in less than 5 seconds. Oh yeah...it was completely silent and included no buckles.\nMAXIMUM BOOT AREA\nThe one piece step/standoff creates a generous boot gripping step size for comfortable, confident climbing. It includes an 8.5\" dual-step width for maximum agility. Our boot containment design engineered into the step geometry, combined with smart traction tread, gives hunters maximum climbing real estate while allowing the top stick to be used as a saddle hunting platform for a quick-and-dirty hunt.\nSUPER COMPACT \u0026amp; QUIET STACKING\nOur patent pending StickLoc™ stacking system is intuitive, whisper quiet, and incredibly strong. It allows you to quickly and efficiently align and stack sticks together for easy transport...no extra straps or fiddle factor required.

Gone are the days of agonizing over “which size should I buy?” or reaching out to social media to ask more experienced saddle hunters. The patent pending shape and cut means the Phantom® fits waist sizes from 28 inches to 40 inches. We recommend the Phantom® XL for waist sizes over 36-38 inches or if you have a big ol’ butt. If you’ve got some serious junk-in-the-trunk, the XL might be just the ticket for you. A shorter, more robust hunter might also prefer the XL.\nCOMFORT CHANNELSThe patent pending Comfort Channels™ provide all day, unsurpassed comfort with easy to use high, medium, and low support settings. The Comfort Channels allow simple, one-handed, adjustment for leaning trees, and give you full control over where you need support most. If you like lower back support, move to the “high” Comfort Channel. If you like more support under your seat, move to the “low” Comfort Channel.\nUTILIBRIDGE™In the past hunters had to sacrifice user-friendliness, or accept more weight and bulk, to have a truly on-demand adjustable bridge. The patent pending UtiliBridge™ is the first of it’s kind constructed with Dynalite™. Our proprietary Dynalite™ material is made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and is one of the strongest pound for pound fibers on the planet.  It’s stronger than steel. It floats. It’s weather resistant. It’s ultralight. It can hold a jeep. Dynalite™ is perfect for outdoor applications. With nearly 37 inches of on-the-fly adjustability, everyone can find their saddle hunting sweet spot. There’s no metal, no bulk, and it’s the strongest adjustable bridge ever made. The UtiliBridge™ checks all the boxes and has tons of upside potential. Looking for the down side? Good luck.\nLINEMAN LOOPSThe Phantom has re-engineered lineman loops to make them more user friendly and even stronger than ever. The large lineman loops are easier to find and use in the dark even with gloves on your hands during the late season. Rest assured the Phantom’s lineman loops will handle anything you can throw at them.\nSPECIAL EDITION SYS HAULERSWe think the SYS Haulers are essential to keep your gear organized and efficient. The Phantom Elite kit comes with 2 special edition SYS Haulers with upgraded secure storage. There’s no limit to what you can store with your SYS Haulers. We like to run our tether and lineman belt on our left hip, and necessary accessories (like the MVP or HYS Strap) on our right hips. However, there’s no wrong way to do it. Since each SYS Hauler is modular and extremely light weight, you can use them to fit your needs.\nSPECIAL EDITION MVPOur Modular Versatile Panel (MVP) gives you all day comfort without sacrificing weight and bulk. It was designed to go from your “knee pits to your arm pits”. Because of the modular build, it can work with any saddle system, no matter the brand or design. The construction was beefed up quite a bit from the Recliner and designed to by bomb proof. With the MVP you get all the benefits of a 2-panel saddle system without the downsides.\nNot only is the Phantom Elite saddle is 100% made in America. The accessories are made with our overseas partners to keep costs down.\nIf you’re looking to be a more efficient hunter and eliminate as much weight and bulk as possible, congratulations…mission accomplished.\n\n","price":399.99,"product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/phantom-elite-saddle?variant=49039345582361","sku":"","image_url":"https://tethrd.com/cdn/shop/files/P1003801-Edit_631f1456-59e3-46a7-82df-4fbb396afc54.jpg?v=1717535030\u0026width=1920","availability":true,"category":"Field and Survival Equipment","tags":["saddle","hunting","ultralock"],"weight":2.1875,"weight_unit":"lbs"},{"name":"Phantom Elite Saddle","brand":"Tethrd","description":"All the features of our best-selling Phantom® and Phantom® XL saddles wrapped in FirstLite® Specter® or Mossy Oak® Bottomland® camo.

USA.\nAll day effortless comfort awaits. The Phantom is the next evolution in ultralight hunting. Try the Phantom and discover why hunters all over the world are ditching their tree stands for the saddle hunting revolution.Waist sizes 28″-36″ should select the Regular. Waist sizes 38″+ should select the XL. See “Sizing” info below for more info.\nSIZINGThe Tethrd® Phantom® is the result of 2 years of testing and research and development. The patent pending shape and cut means the Phantom® fits waist sizes from 28 inches to 40 inches. If your waist size is up to 36″, you should select the REGULAR. If you are a 36″ and larger, you should select the XL. However this isn’t set in stone. Some hunters with smaller waists, but with a little more “junk in the trunk” like to run the XL version. If you’re on the fence…you may want to size up first. But don’t worry no matter which way you go, we’ll get you sorted out if your size selection doesn’t work out.COMFORT CHANNELSThe patent pending Comfort Channels™ provide all day, unsurpassed comfort with easy to use high, medium, and low support settings. The Comfort Channels allow simple, one-handed, adjustment for leaning trees, and give you full control over where you need support most. If you like lower back support, move to the “high” Comfort Channel. If you like more support under your seat, move to the “low” Comfort Channel.UTILIBRIDGE™In the past hunters had to sacrifice user-friendliness, or accept more weight and bulk, to have a truly on-demand adjustable bridge. The patent pending UtiliBridge™ is the first of it’s kind constructed with Dynalite™. Our proprietary Dynalite™ material is made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and is one of the strongest pound for pound fibers on the planet. It’s stronger than steel. It floats. It’s weather resistant. It’s ultralight. It can hold a jeep. Dynalite™ is perfect for outdoor applications. With nearly 30 inches of on-the-fly adjustability, everyone can find their saddle hunting sweet spot. There’s no metal, no bulk, and it’s the strongest adjustable bridge ever made. The UtiliBridge™ checks all the boxes and has tons of upside potential. Looking for the down side? Good luck.LINEMAN LOOPSThe Phantom has re-engineered lineman loops to make them more user friendly and even stronger than ever. The large patent pending lineman loops are easier to find and use in the dark, even with gloves on your hands during the late season. Rest assured the Phantom’s lineman loops will handle anything you can throw at them.FREEDOM BELTWe upgraded the waist belt on the Phantom to a completely new ultra-wide, ultra-adjustable design. We eliminated the tri-glide adjustment system used on all other Tethrd saddles. This simplified belt makes one-handed belt cinching a breeze. The all-new floating design means you have unlimited positioning options for your buckle. You can position the buckle on your left or right side, or right in the middle of your waist. You can also easily adjust the position for early season or late season settings.SUSPENSION KIT READYThe Phantom is ready to give you all the support you need. We’ve listened to a lot of saddle hunters who wished there was a suspender option for their saddle. Our brand new Suspension Kit is designed to work seamlessly with the Phantom. The Suspension Kit will also work with any saddle that incorporates standard molle loops. *Suspension Kit sold separately.Not only is the Phantom the most efficient elevated hunting saddle ever built…it’s 100% made in America.

Saddle, we went for ultralight and very modular. That’s the reason it’s the greatest selling saddle of all time. But we listened to you guys who were willing to carry a bit more weight \u0026amp; bulk in exchange for maximum comfort and created the Ultralock. This thing is the Cadillac of Comfiness!\nThe Ultralock includes: Ultralock Expandable Saddle, UtiliBridge™ \u0026amp; Comfort Channels™, 2x Ultralock Haulers with IFS, Ultralock Modular Yoke, 2 sets of Ultralock Links\nRegular = 28″-36″ waist | XL = +38″ waist\nThe Ultralock saddle is the KING of COMFORT.\nOver the past 2 years we've tested and refined a new approach to our saddle lineup. We wanted to reimagine comfort and user-friendliness. The Ultralock takes the best in class features from our Phantom like our UtiliBridge™, Comfort Channels™, and integrated lineman loops and adds in our Expandable Saddle Body with Ultralock Link construction to create a mega-comfortable saddle that expands and contracts with you throughout your hunt. Not only does the Ultralock  revolutionize comfort in a saddle, but our new oversized Ultralock Haulers with integrated skeleton frame make frustrating gear access a thing of the past. Finally, our new bomb proof yoke system means you can load up your Ultralock and not worry about keeping it in place. The Ultralock is the next evolution in saddle hunting comfort. You're gonna LOVE it.\nULTRALOCK LINKS\nOur brand new Ultralock Links are a fresh take on an expandable saddle. The biggest complaint with pleated saddles is the inability to close the pleat while in transport mode moving to and from your hunting area. They tend to open at the wrong time and flop around. Pleated saddles all suffer from this issue and can lead to an annoying user experience. We re-engineered the concept and created an Expandable Saddle Body to work hand-in-hand with our Ultralock Link system to solve this issue. Our Expandable Saddle Body allows the saddle to move with you while walking, climbing, and hunting. The Ultralock Links are removable, adjustable, and user replaceable. Hunters can dial in their specific comfort setting, and replace them if they wear out, get lost, or get damaged. You get two sets with the Ultralock : 1 pre-installed, and 1 replacement set.\nULTRALOCK HAULERS\nOur brand new Ultralock Hauler with built in IFS (Internal Frame Structure) is the first of its kind. With IFS, gear management becomes so much easier. Ultralock Haulers work like a dream by providing an incredibly simple one-handed operation. We also made the Ultralock haulers plenty big for those who like to carry lots of gear. We doubled the volume compared to our original SYS Haulers, while reducing the exterior profile to make the Ultralock even more sleek. They're sewn right into the saddle body which adds structure \u0026amp; comfort to the entire system. Finally, we added plenty of organization, and even a built-in grommet system for those who use a retractable gear hoist. Get Haulin!\nULTRALOCK MODULAR YOKE\nOur brand new Yoke System takes Tethrd saddles to the next level. If you have issues with your saddle not wanting to stay put where you like it, our Yoke will solve that problem. It's light weight, modular, and bombproof. The Ultralock comes with the Yoke ready to go. It's also removable in about 15 seconds. If you want to run your Ultralock in minimalist mode, drop the Yoke at home and head to the woods. Finally, the Yoke is backwards compatible with our Phantom Saddle for when you want to hunt even lighter and faster.\nUTILIBRIDGE™ \u0026amp; COMFORT CHANNELS™\nOur patented UtiliBridge™ is the KING of adjustable saddle hunting bridges. Your bridge is incredibly important for comfort, durability, and 360 degree shooting. With nearly 40 inches of on-the-fly adjustability, everyone can find their saddle hunting sweet spot. UtiliBridge™ works with your setup to make every hunt as simple as possible. Our patented Comfort Channels™ provide all day, unsurpassed comfort with seven different high, medium, and low support settings. The Comfort Channels allow simple, one-handed adjustment for leaning trees and weird positions, while giving you full control over where you need support most.\nMADE IN THE USA...MOSTLY\nIn order to protect your wallets, we chose to manufacture the Ultralock in a unique way. We built the load bearing components (Saddle Chassis, Bridge Loops, UtiliBridge, Lineman Loops, etc.) here in the USA. To save you money, we imported the non-load bearing components (Ultralock Haulers \u0026amp; Yoke) from our overseas partners and assembled everything right here in Texas. This way you get the best of both worlds: Made in America load bearing components \u0026amp; assembly, and wallet-friendly off-shore accessories. So rest assured, if you see any \"made in China\" tags or uninformed comments on social media...that only applies to the non-load bearing accessories. We want to be transparent and honest so there's no surprises.\n\n \n","price":429.99,"product_url":"https://tethrd.com/products/ultralock-saddle?variant=48011101208857","sku":"","image_url":"https://tethrd.com/cdn/shop/files/ultralock-11.jpg?v=1710337544\u0026width=1920","availability":true,"category":"Field and Survival Equipment","tags":["Ultralock","Comfort","Saddle"],"weight":2.1875,"weight_unit":"lbs"},{"name":"Ultralock Saddle","brand":"Tethrd","description":"With our Phantom Saddle, we went for ultralight and very modular.

We doubled the volume compared to our original SYS Haulers, while reducing the exterior profile to make the Ultralock even more sleek. They're sewn right into the saddle body which adds structure \u0026amp; comfort to the entire system. Finally, we added plenty of organization, and even a built-in grommet system for those who use a retractable gear hoist. Get Haulin!\nULTRALOCK MODULAR YOKE\nOur brand new Yoke System takes Tethrd saddles to the next level. If you have issues with your saddle not wanting to stay put where you like it, our Yoke will solve that problem. It's light weight, modular, and bombproof. The Ultralock comes with the Yoke ready to go. It's also removable in about 15 seconds. If you want to run your Ultralock in minimalist mode, drop the Yoke at home and head to the woods. Finally, the Yoke is backwards compatible with our Phantom Saddle for when you want to hunt even lighter and faster.\nUTILIBRIDGE™ \u0026amp; COMFORT CHANNELS™\nOur patented UtiliBridge™ is the KING of adjustable saddle hunting bridges. Your bridge is incredibly important for comfort, durability, and 360 degree shooting. With nearly 40 inches of on-the-fly adjustability, everyone can find their saddle hunting sweet spot. UtiliBridge™ works with your setup to make every hunt as simple as possible. Our patented Comfort Channels™ provide all day, unsurpassed comfort with seven different high, medium, and low support settings. The Comfort Channels allow simple, one-handed adjustment for leaning trees and weird positions, while giving you full control over where you need support most.\nMADE IN THE USA...MOSTLY\nIn order to protect your wallets, we chose to manufacture the Ultralock in a unique way. We built the load bearing components (Saddle Chassis, Bridge Loops, UtiliBridge, Lineman Loops, etc.) here in the USA. To save you money, we imported the non-load bearing components (Ultralock Haulers \u0026amp; Yoke) from our overseas partners and assembled everything right here in Texas. This way you get the best of both worlds: Made in America load bearing components \u0026amp; assembly, and wallet-friendly off-shore accessories. So rest assured, if you see any \"made in China\" tags or uninformed comments on social media...that only applies to the non-load bearing accessories. We want to be transparent and honest so there's no surprises.\n\n
