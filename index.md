### About Me

I get paid to edit text files and type in a monochromatic window.

When that gets too boring I read about fake people doing stuff in places that don't exist.
Then I get upset when I see those same fake people on a screen doing the wrong things and saying the wrong words.

Sometimes I get tired of sitting in a chair so I put padding on my hands and legs and hit other people, with their consent.

I have crossed a large number of internationally recognized borders and use this as a way to make myself feel superior to others who have not crossed as many borders as I.

### About You

If you need help creating your application and/or migrating it into the cloud, my friends and I can take care of that for you.
